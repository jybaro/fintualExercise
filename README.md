# Fintual exercise - simple Portfolio class

This repo contains a very simple Portfolio class, implemented with TypeScript.

## Exercise details

_Construct a simple Portfolio class that has a collection of Stocks and a “Profit” method that receives 2 dates and returns the profit of the Portfolio between those dates. Assume each Stock has a “Price” method that receives a date and returns its price. Bonus Track: make the Profit method return the “annualized return” of the portfolio between the given dates._

## Concerns

I could not understand the "annualized return" part, sorry :(
